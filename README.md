### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

  - First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a first time visitor, I want to have a good overview of the content and I want to quickly understand the main purpose of the site.
        1. When the users are entering the landing page the first thing they should notice is a plate with food and the title recipe share - so they should quickly understand the main purpouse.
        2. By clicking at the button ("See recipes") the users are getting redirected to the main site where they can see all the recipes that have been posted so far.
        3. A minimalistic and simple design should make the purpouse clear and easy understadeble.
        4. Font awesome icons or png images should help make the website's pupouse more understadeble.

    2. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to navigate easily through all the different sections/pages without any complications.
        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the users.
        2. The navigation bar is very simply held - either (classic) at the very top of the website on desktop or laptop devices (or on landscape mode on tablets etc.) or collapsible on smaller devices like tablets or mobile phones. 
        3. There are some additional navigational options like the button or profile link on the landing page.
        4. To not overload the navigation bar and to keep it as readeble as possible, links (i.e.) for editing the users profile is on the profile page (good visible).

    3. As a first time visitor, I want do discover the content and get an overview before I register.
        1. Before registering there are less options in the navbar.
        2. The users can check out the main page (where all recipes are listed) or check out social media (landing page).
        3. To being able to post their own recipes and having the possibility to use the actual potential of the website - they have to register.

    5. As a first time visitor, I want to (eventually) share my own recipes with the community right away.
        1. The only thing to do is to register
        2. Then the option of posting your own recipes will be available (navbar)
        3. Posting a recipe is very intuitive and relativly quick.

    6. As a first time visitor, I want to get inspired and motivated to try some new and interesting recipes.
        1. Users will post more and more recipes with time. For example there could be more then one recipe for pancakes or users could discover recipes they never even heared of.


    7. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to edit or delete my recipes if I'm not happy with them.

        1. If users posted a recipe right away they still can edit or delete them if they made any mistakes or are not completly happy with their creation.


    8. As a first time visitor, I want to (eventually) follow the website on certain social media pattforms.

        1. Since having follower on social media is not the main purpouse of the website this option is only available on the landing page to keep the rest of the sites as "clean" as possible.

        1. Recipes are sorted so the most recent ones are on the top.

        1. If the user discovered a new recipe or has an idea how to improve an other recipe they saw they can post it and share it with the community.


    4. As a returning visitor, I want to (eventually) improve or remove some of my own recipes.

        1. If the users see a mistake in their posted recipe they have the option to easily change it or even delete it if they want. 

    5. As a returning visitor, I want to (eventually) edit my profile.

## Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

  1. Log in to GitHub and locate the <a href="https://github.com/RobertMachamud/developers_nostalgia">GitHub Repository</a>
  2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
  3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.


## Making a Local Clone

  1. Log in to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>  and locate the <a href="https://github.com/RobertMachamud/developers_nostalgia">GitHub Repository</a>
  2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
  3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
  4. Open Git Bash
  5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  6. Type `git clone` , and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
```
 $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

  7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.

## Note
  - I know I could have used Bootstrap or Materialize for better (and easier) responsiveness but I intentionally chose to use mostly plain css to get more comfortable with it and to improve my skills by beeing forced to improvise, use diffent (and newly learned) skills etc. 
  In this project I tried to understand css combinators and to use them a lot.
